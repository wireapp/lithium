## Lithium

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wireapp/lithium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wireapp/lithium)

- Lithium is Wire Services SDK written in Java

## How to use it to build your bots?
- In your `pom.xml`:
```
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.wire</groupId>
        <artifactId>lithium</artifactId>
        <version>3.3.1</version>
    </dependency>
<dependencies>
```

If you want to use [Version]() resource (API endpoint), you must create version file during the build.
For example, during the Docker build, one can put following code inside `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
# create version file
ARG release_version=development
ENV RELEASE_FILE_PATH=/path/to/release.txt
RUN echo $release_version > $RELEASE_FILE_PATH
```
And than add build argument ie. in the build pipeline 
[like that](https://github.com/dkovacevic/roman/blob/8d41bcba20a8f7607210263944c9ccecd757ed44/.github/workflows/release.yml#L26).

## How to register your service with Wire

The `manage.sh` script helps you register as a service provider, create a certificate, and register your service instance.

### Script requirements

- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)

### How to use the script

In order to register a service, you need to generate a certificate (or bring your own), register as a provider and then register the service.

Using the `manage.sh` script:

- Register as a provider with `manage.sh new-provider`. If everything goes well, the response will contain a password and provider ID, and you should get an email. Open the email and follow the link in the email to confirm your identity. You need to do this only once, even when developing multiple services. This will save the credentials in the local folder, for further authentication.
- If you don't have a certificate already, create a new certificate with `manage.sh new-cert` and follow the instructions. This needs to match the certificate that is used for the SSL termination on your service.
- Deploy your service and make it accessible by public IP, using HTTPS and the certificate you created at step one.
- Obtain an authentication token with `manage.sh auth-provider`. This is a temporary token to perform authenticated requests, and will need to be refreshed periodically if you don't use the script for more than 10 minutes.
- Register a new service with `manage.sh new-service` and enter the required information. Make sure the base URL is an `https` URL. You will receive an service auth token.
- Once a server is created, you can update it with `manage.sh update-service`. 
- Edit the YAML configuration file of your service and add the service token you received at the previous step.
- (Re)-start the service with the new configuration file.
- Activate the service with `manage.sh update-service-conn` to make it _enabled_

## Use Hello World sample service as your first service

- [Hello World](https://github.com/wireapp/echo-bot)

## Environment variables used:
- `WIRE_API_HOST`: Wire Backend. `https://prod-nginz-https.wire.com` by default
- `SERVICE_TOKEN`: Your service authentication token. All requests sent by the BE will have this token as Bearer Authorization HTTP header

## Logging to JSON
Wire uses JSON logging in the production. To enable JSON logging one must specify `json-console` appender in the Dropwizard yaml.
```yaml
logging:
  appenders:
    - type: json-console
```
